I have added following features to original [OpenSearch Ansible playbook](https://github.com/opensearch-project/ansible-playbook)

- Vargantfile for full stack testing
- maximum avoiding root operations
- "# vim:ft=ansible:"
- host_download: ability to download artifacts on ansible controller. remotes can in closed segment w/o inet. Also it can help with slow internet connection  

Enjoy the DevOps life!
